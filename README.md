# Custom Player Inventory

Customize the appearance of your player's inventory window!

By default, this mod will place your inventory panel on the right side and equipment on the left, consistent with other containers in the game.

This mod was inspired by a suggestion from `Ecconia#4929`.

## Features

Pick from a preset, or specify values to your liking.
There aren't many limiters on the values you can set,
so you can make some pretty wacky setups with this mod.

Configure the following properties:

* Left/right offset
* Up/down offset
* Scale
* Rotation

Of these portions of the inventory:

* Inventory panel
* Equipment panel
* Keybind hints

## Screenshots

Here are screenshots of the presets on offer,
which are just a small sample of what you could do with this mod.

## Compatibility Notes

* This mod modifies the render transforms of the inventory window, so anything that adds new UI to the inventory could end up completley distorted by this.

## Known Bugs

* The regions you must drag items to in order to drop them into the world the same as vanilla's - you can't drop items in the "center" of your screen if you move the widgets out of the way. I don't plan to change this.
* The "moving items" animation will still use the "real" position of the item before your customizations. I don't plan to fix this.
* Opening the configs screen moves your cursor. This is caused by the base game when the inventory widget is spawned.
