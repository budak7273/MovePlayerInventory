# Custom Player Inventory

**Multiplayer Compatible!** _Client-side only mod, it will work as long as the server has SML installed._

Customize the appearance of your player inventory interface!

By default, this mod will place your inventory panel on the right side and equipment on the left, consistent with other containers in the game.

This mod was inspired by a suggestion from `Ecconia#4929`.

## Features

Pick from a preset, or specify values to your liking.
There aren't many limiters on the values you can set,
so you can make some pretty wacky setups with this mod.

Configure the following properties:

* Left/right offset
* Up/down offset
* Scale
* Rotation

Of these portions of the inventory:

* Inventory panel
* Equipment panel
* Keybind hints
* Dimensional Depot panel

Here are screenshots of some of the presets on offer,

## Usage Instructions

Once you have installed the mod with Satisfactory Mod Manager,
the next time you open your inventory, a flashing yellow tutorial icon will appear that tells you how to configure the mod.

All of this mod's features can be configured
from the in-game SML Mod Configs screen,
which can be accessed from the main menu or pause menu.
All of these settings can be changed while the game is running.

Once on the config screen,
you can hover over a slider to get a description of what it does.

Select a preset from the "Select from Preset" dropdown,
or use the sliders to arrange your inventory as you see fit.

You can press 'Refresh Preview' on the config screen to get a preview of what your inventory will look like.

## Compatibility Notes

* This mod modifies the render transforms of the inventory window,
  so anything that adds new UI to the inventory could end up completely distorted by this.

## Known Bugs

* The regions you must drag items to in order to drop them into the world the same as vanilla's - you can't drop items in the "center" of your screen if you move the widgets out of the way. I don't plan to change this.
* Opening the configs screen moves your cursor. This is caused by the base game when the inventory widget is spawned.
* The Dimensional Depot panel's open/closed state affects the placement of other panels. Some layouts and presents will look weird if it's not expanded.
