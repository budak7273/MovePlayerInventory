1.0 support. Ability to move Dimensional Depot window. New preset.




This update brought to you by Robb.
If you enjoy my work, please consider my [completely optional tip jar](https://ko-fi.com/robb4).

## New Stuff

- Added new preset: `Depot on the Right, Equipment on the Left (Requires Dimensional Depot)`
- Added ability to move the Dimensional Depot window. The window has unusual effects on the layout, breaking some existing layouts and making them unusable if the panel is not expanded.

## Changed Stuff

- Edited existing presets to support the Dimensional Depot, renaming those that must have it expanded to look correct.
  - `Pushed to the Sides (Requires Dimensional Depot)`
  - `Persona (Requires Dimensional Depot)`
- Made the `Australia` preset be the Australia version of the base-game default instead of the mod default.
- Disable multiplayer version check to enable usage in multiplayer regardless of if the host has the mod installed.
- Published dedicated server versions of the mod that do nothing to ease 'modpack' creation.
